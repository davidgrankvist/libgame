# libgame

A library for making games.

## About

This is a game-flavoured platform layer. It provides utilities like creating windows, processing input and rendering.
There are also additional abstractions like cameras.

The library is written from scratch. This is inspired by Casey Muratori's amazing Handmade Hero series.

## Documentation

There are docs about different things under [docs/](./docs/):

- for overview of things like code structure, building and porting, see [Developer Guide](./docs/developerGuide.md)
- for a summary of some game programming concepts, see [Concepts, Tips and Tricks](./docs/conceptsTipsAndTricks.md)
