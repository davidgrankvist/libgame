# flat-worlds

A game about flat worlds.

## About

One of the goals of this project is to implement a lot of things from scratch to learn things and enjoy the process.
This is inspired by Casey Muratori's amazing Handmade Hero series.

### Notes

I have notes about different things under [docs/](./docs/).
